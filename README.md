# Colors
A little project that simply contains some popular color definitions. 
It contains the Material Design colors and the Flat UI colors. 
You will find two classes with the color definitions and 
for each color definition class there is a JavaFX color picker app 
that shows you the colors and copy the clicked color to the clipboard.
